      Hello! Greetings, 
      I am a junior software developer, and my dedication and aspiration is to learn as much as I can with the help of the Google, Youtube, and my education with Mesa Community College and UCSD Extention Bootcamp. I discovered my admiration to programming back in high school when I participate in the Robotics club for 3 years. I realized my path for life was not to become a Respiratory Therapist because of the sad environment I wouldn't be able to handle. Overall, I am a helpful person who participated in many organizations, clubs, and programs back in the days which grew my connections, knowledge, skills, and the understanding of proper leadership skills and team work.
